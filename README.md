# Market Basket Analysis in R

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project performs **Market Basket Analysis** using the **Apriori algorithm** to uncover product associations from transaction data. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- **groceries.csv**: a dataset with groceries transaction details.  

## ðŸ“Š Methodology  
1. Loading The Necessary Libraries: rules, arulesViz, and readr.
2. Loading The Dataset:
3. Apply the Apriori Algorithm: Extract association rules.  
4. Evaluate Model Performance: Use **confidence** and **lift** to identify meaningful patterns.  
5. Improve Model Performance: sorting association rules and extracting subsets.
